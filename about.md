I'm currently living in Gothenburg while studying at Chalmers University of
Technology. I'm in the computer science engineering program. I started in
industrial design engineering but I realised I wanted to work on the more
technical parts of UX.

My biggest interest is music. During high school I played i several rockbands
back in my hometown, Uppsala. Now at Chalmers I play drums in a student
orchestra, AllianceOrchestret.

This is my personal website where you can find stuff I've done and random
thoughts. I built this version during the spring of 2015 but it's always a work
in progress.
