<!-- technical parts of UX. -->

<!-- My biggest interest is music. During high school I played i several rockbands -->
<!-- back in my hometown, Uppsala. Now at Chalmers I play drums in a student -->
<!-- orchestra, AllianceOrchestret. -->

<!-- This is my personal website where you can find stuff I've done and random -->

Computer Science Engineering student who wants to build products users love.
Great JavaScript and CSS skills, including React. Prefers functional
programming.  Strong communication skills developed in several nonprofit
commitments.

Outside of programming I spend time on synthesisers and coffee.

Currently writing my master thesis with the draft title: Symbolic Functional Finite
Exterior Calculus. We aim to improve the performance of a partial differential
equation solver by implementing the front-end as a symbolic domain specific
language written in Haskell.
