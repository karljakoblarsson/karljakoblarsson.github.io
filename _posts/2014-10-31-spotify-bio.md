Who am I?

-----------------------------------------------

I am Karl Jakob Larsson.
Right now I live in Gothenburg and study engineering at Chalmers.
I'm in my second year at the computer engineering program.
When I started at Chalmers i studied industrial design engineering.
It was really a lot of fun trying to improve everyday objects.
Building physical prototypes and lots of sketching.

But after a few months I started to realize I wanted to work with more digital design.
Building the "smart"-objects of the future.
Creating really great interfaces.

I figured the best way to do that was to become really good at programming.
So I switched over to computer engineering.

One of my big intrests beside music is computer science.
I read about datastructures when I should study for exams.
So the switch was quite natural.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making this switch have given me a unique perspective.
The industrial design engineering program is one of the few engineering programs
with a 50/50 gender distributon.
The distribution in the computer engineering program is less than 10% women.
That is really bad.
Industrial design engineering has a much nicer and more creative enviroment.
There are of course many other factors in this but I'm certain the gender distribution
is a big part of it.
Programming is a really creative endevor,
and I think that the education suffer from the bad gender distrbution.


Programming and design is really similar in my mind. Both are different parts
of the same process.

Sometimes I entertain myself by writing javascript stuff:

* [Small game I did.](https://rawgit.com/karljakoblarsson/Drive-Away/master/index.html)
  A small game i wanted to test. Written in raw javascript with canvas.
  Lots of things are missing. Most notably sound and nice visuals.

* [Fractalz](https://rawgit.com/karljakoblarsson/Fractalz/master/index.html)
  Trying to render the [Fractal Flame](https://www.google.com/search?q=fractal+flame)
  algorithm i js. It works but is really slow.
  A few parts of the algorithm is missing. But it can do cool visuals still.
  The interface is code. There should probably be some kind of editor for the flames
  in the future.
