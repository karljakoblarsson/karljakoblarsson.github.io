Who am I?
=========

The picture is of me at Lundakarnevalen 2014.
Playing drums with my dear orchestra AllianceOrchestret.

~This (obviously) not complete.
I only heard about this event yesterday and didn't have time for more than to
fill out the signup form.
I guessed (hoped) that you wouldnt get here before I could fix it.~


I am Karl Jakob Larsson.
Right now I live in Gothenburg and study engineering at Chalmers.
I'm in my second year at the Computer engineering programme.
I first enrolled in Industrial design engineering.
It was a lot of fun trying to improe everyday objects.
Building physical prototype and drawing.

But after a few months I started to realize I to work with more digital design.
Building the "smart"-objects of the future to use a current buzzword.
Interfaces.
I figured the best way to do that was to become really good at programming.
So I switched programme.

One of my big intrests beside music is Computer science.
I read about datastructures when I should study for exams.
So the switch was quite natural.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The computer science program is much less diverse.
That sucks.
I still want to do things.
Programming and design is much the same thing.
But why does most women choose design?


Sometimes I entertain myself by writing javascript stuff:
