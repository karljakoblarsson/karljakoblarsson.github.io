Who am I?
=========
![Me at lundakarnevalen 2014]({{ site.url }}/images/karljakoblarsson-lunda14.jpg)

The picture is of me at Lundakarnevalen 2014.
Playing drums with my dear orchestra AllianceOrchestret.

This (obviously) not complete.
I only heard about this event yesterday and didn't have time for more than to
fill out the signup form.
I guessed (hoped) that you wouldnt get here before I could fix it.


I am Karl Jakob Larsson.
Right now I live in Gothenburg to study engineering at Chalmers.




Engineering student at Chalmers.
In my second year.
Now I study Computer Science.
A started in Industrial design engineering becouse I wanted to be better at design.
I realized I want to design digital intefaces so I switched.


The computer science program is much less diverse.
That sucks.
I still want to do things.
Programming and design is much the same thing.
But why does most women choose design?


Sometimes I entertain myself by writing javascript stuff:
