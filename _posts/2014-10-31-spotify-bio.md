Who am I?
=========

This (obviously) not complete.
I only heard about this event yesterday and didn't have time for more than to
fill out the signup form.
I guessed (hoped) that you wouldnt get to it before I could fix it.



Engineering student at Chalmers.
In my second year.
Now I study Computer Science.
A started in Industrial design engineering becouse I wanted to be better at design.
I realized I want to design digital intefaces so I switched.


The computer science program is much less diverse.
That sucks.
I still want to do things.
Programming and design is much the same thing.
But why does most women choose design?


Sometimes I entertain myself by writing javascript stuff:
