I've been sketching on a typeface design for a while now.
Last month I finally had the courage to start "implmenting" it.
I was inspired by 20's futurism, wordfairs, Bauhaus and Alvar Alto.

It features sleek, thin letters with simple geometric forms based on circles
and lines only.

It's only intended for big eye-catching headlines in all caps.
